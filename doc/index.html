    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>Worm is a simple game written in Java, using javax.swing as the graphics library. The object is to eat as many fruits and bonus fruits as possible without colliding with brick wall or worm's tail. The game starts with short trivial worm and one normal fruit. After normal fruits are eaten, they turn to bonus fruits (flashing) until the worm's tail leaves them. Eating a bonus fruit results in an extra normal fruit available and slightly more units added to worm's tail. The game accelerates when score increases.</p>
    <h2>Game controls</h2>
    <p>The worm is controlled by arrow keys. SPACE is used for signalling game start and switching PAUSE mode on and off.</p>
